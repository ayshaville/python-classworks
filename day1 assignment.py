# differences between a tuple and a list 

# tuple:
#       a tuple is like a fixed collection of items that can not be changed once created, it can contain
# different data types like float, integer, etc. it uses a curve bracket "()"

# example of a tuple
friuts= ("apple", "banana", "strawberry", 5) 
    # note: friuts is a variable.


# list
#       a list can be defined as a dynamic collection of items that can be changed. unlike a tupple,
# it has square bracket "[]"

# example of a list

drinks= ["fanta", "coke", "sprite"]
    #  note: drinks is a variable.


# string formatting
#     string formatting can be defined as a way to insert valuesinto a string. for example, a variable
# "name" with the value "ayshar". you can use string formatting to insert the value "name"into a sentence.
# Sometimes there are parts of a text that you do not control, maybe they come from a database, or user input?
# To control such values, add placeholders (curly brackets {}) in the text, and run the values through the format() method:

# for example

name= "aysha"
text= "my name is {}, and am a girl"
print(text.format(name))


# addition

x= 5
y= 10
print(x+y)

# subtraction

x= 20
y= 8
print(x-y)

# multiplication

x= 30
y= 2
print(x*y)

# divition

x= 50
y= 2
print(x/y)

# note: to avoid the decimal point u can use double divition sign
